<span class="anchor" id="license-expiration"></span>
<h3>Why does my license show an expiration date? I thought FusionInvoice was buy once, use forever?</h3>

<p>You're right - it is, and it always will be! Renewing your support period is completely optional. FusionInvoice will never stop
    working simply because your support period has expired. Renewing your support period gives you access to another full year of support
    and program updates (every update, including major version releases).
</p>

<hr>

<span class="anchor" id="change-status-paid"></span>
<h3>Why can't I change the status to paid?</h3>

<p>
    The paid status is the only status you cannot manually change an invoice to. To
    change an invoice to Paid status, the
    invoice must have a payment made in full. Once the invoice has no remaining balance,
    the status will automatically
    update to Paid.
</p>

<hr>

<span class="anchor" id="troubleshooting-recurring-invoices"></span>
<h3>Why aren't my recurring invoices working?</h3>

<p>First, check the Next Date of the recurring invoice you expect should have generated.</p>

<a href="../../../assets/img/docs/2018/troubleshoot_recurring_invoices.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="../../../assets/img/docs/2018/troubleshoot_recurring_invoices_small.png"
         class="img-responsive">
</a>

<ol>
    <li>Click Recurring Invoices.</li>
    <li>The date in the Next Date field indicates the date which this invoice should recur next. If this date is in the
        future, then the invoice isn't ready to recur yet.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    If the Next Date is today's date or prior to today's date but the recurring invoice hasn't been generated, then the
    next step would be to visit http://YourFusionInvoiceURL/tasks/run (or
    http://YourFusionInvoiceURL/index.php/tasks/run if
    you have to specify index.php in your URL).</p>
<p>
    One of two things will happen when you visit this URL in your browser:
<ol>
    <li>
        You'll be greeted by an empty, white page. This is good - if you go back to check your list of recurring
        invoices, you should find that the Next Date has incremented to the next date in the set frequency. You should
        also find that the new invoice has appeared in your list of invoices. If this is the case. then the
        <a href="../Setup/Task-Scheduler.html">Task Scheduler</a> cron job hasn't
        been set up or has been set up improperly.
    </li>
    <li>
        You'll be greeted with a lovely, "Whoops..." error message. If this is the case, there will be details logged
        at the bottom of your storage/logs/laravel.log file.
    </li>

</ol>
</p>

<span class="anchor" id="how-do-i-reset-my-password"></span>
<h3>I forgot my password - how can I reset it?</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Download the <a href="../../../ResetPassword-2018.zip">Reset Password</a> utility.</li>
    <li>Unzip the contents.</li>
    <li>Upload the unzipped ResetPassword folder to the app/Modules folder on your server so that it becomes
        app/Modules/ResetPassword.
    </li>
    <li>Visit your FusionInvoiceURL/resetpassword to reset your password.</li>
    <li>Once your password has been reset, <strong>delete the app/Modules/ResetPassword folder from your server</strong>.
    </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<span class="anchor" id="dashboard-totals"></span>
<h3>Why do the totals on my dashboard all show zero?</h3>
<a href="../../../assets/img/docs/faq_dashboard_totals.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="../../../assets/img/docs/faq_dashboard_totals_small.png" class="img-responsive">
</a>
<p>
    There are settings on the Dashboard tab of System Settings which control this behavior for both quotes and invoices.
    The default option is Year to Date. This can be changed to This Quarter, All Time, or Custom Date Range.</p>

<hr>

<span class="anchor" id="supported-payment-gateways"></span>
<h3>Can FusionInvoice work with XYZ payment gateway?</h3>

<p>
    FusionInvoice uses the <a href="../../../../external.html?link=https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay" target="_blank">Omnipay</a> payment
    processing library which supports a large number of different
    <a href="../../../../external.html?link=https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay#payment-gateways" target="_blank">payment gateways</a>. Even though
    Omnipay supports a large number of gateways, FusionInvoice implements support for those gateways upon popular
    request. If a gateway is on the list of Omnipay supported gateways that isn't yet implemented in FusionInvoice,
    please don't hesitate to ask! However, if Omnipay does not support a particular gateway, then FusionInvoice will not
    support it either.
</p>

<hr>

<span class="anchor" id="how-to-remove-index-php"></span>
<h3>How can I remove index.php from my URL?</h3>

<h4>If you're using Apache, try these things in the order they're listed below:</h4>

<ol>
    <li>
        Verify that the .htaccess file distributed in the FusionInvoice download file was actually uploaded to your
        server. This file should exist in the root folder of your FusionInvoice installation (in the same folder as the
        index.php file). This file should work out of the box 99% of the time for Apache environments.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make sure the Apache mod_rewrite module is installed and enabled. If you are unsure of how to check for this,
        contact your web host support or system administrator to ask them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Open the .htaccess file and change this:
        <pre>RewriteEngine On</pre>
        to this:
        <pre>RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /</pre>
        If RewriteBase / makes no difference, you can also try:
        <pre>RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /TheNameOfYourFusionInvoiceFolder/</pre>
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>If you're using nginx:</h4>

<p>Add the following location directive (or change your existing location directive) in your site configuration
    file:</p>

<pre>
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}
</pre>

<h4>If you're using IIS:</h4>

<p>Use <a href="../../../../external.html?link=http://www.iis.net/learn/extensions/url-rewrite-module/importing-apache-modrewrite-rules">this guide</a>
    to import the include mod_rewrite rules from the .htaccess file into a web.config file for IIS.</p>

<hr>

<span class="anchor" id="how-to-force-https"></span>
<h3>How can I force my FusionInvoice installation to be served over https?</h3>

<p>
    Version 2018-4 added an option to the General tab of System Settings which will force FusionInvoice to be served over https.
    Prior to enabling this option, be sure your FusionInvoice installation is functional via https. Failure to do so may result in a
    non-functional (but fixable) installation.
</p>

<p>
    It is recommended that your server environment be configured to redirect incoming requests from http to https, but if this is
    not an option, you may enable the Force HTTPS option in System Settings.
</p>

<p>If you're unable to access your installation after enabling the Force HTTPS option, run the following query in your FusionInvoice database to undo the change:</p>

<pre>
update settings set setting_value = '0' where setting_key = 'forceHttps'
</pre>
