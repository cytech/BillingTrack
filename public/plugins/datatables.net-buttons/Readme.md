# Buttons for DataTables 

This package contains distribution files for the [Buttons extension](https://datatables.net/extensions/Buttons) for [DataTables](https://datatables.net/). Only the core software for this library is contained in this package - to be correctly styled, a styling package for Buttons must also be included. Styling options include DataTable's native styling, [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).

The Buttons extension for DataTables provides a common set of options, API methods and styling to display buttons on a page that will interact with a DataTable. It also provides plug-ins for file export (HTML5 and Flash), print view and column visibility. Other libraries, such as Editor and Select also provide buttons specific to their use cases.
