### How do I add a client?

Click the Clients menu item and press the New button.

[<img src="/img/documentation/client_create_sm.png" class="img-responsive" />](/img/documentation/client_create.png)

Use the Client Form screen to fill in details and contact information
for your client.

Addresses can be maintained in two different ways. It is recommended to
choose either option and stick with it for all clients. The first option
is to use the Address field to store the entire address - including
street address, city, state, postal code, country, etc. This option
allows you to easily format the address as you need to with no
additional fuss. The other option is to store the address, city, state,
postal code and country values in their respective fields.

To allow the client to login to the Client Center, see [How do I create logins for my clients?](#how-do-i-create-logins-for-my-clients).

Press the Save button when finished.

### How do I add multiple contacts to my clients?

On the client view screen, select the Add Contact button.

[<img src="/img/documentation/client_contact1_sm.png" class="img-responsive" />](/img/documentation/client_contact1.png)

Enter contact information. Name will automatically join Firstname and
Lastname (but can be over-ridden). You can set whether this contact is
the primary or not (only one primary can exist and if adding a new
contact as primary when a primary is already defined, the system will
promote the new contact to primary). Optin is a tag set so you can track
email optin requests from a contact. Press the Save button when
complete. Existing contacts will be shown and may be edited, trashed, or
change of email defaults.

Once the contact has been added, you can set them as a default to, cc or
bcc recipient for outgoing quotes and invoices for the client the
contact was added to.

[<img src="/img/documentation/client_contact3_sm.png" class="img-responsive" />](/img/documentation/client_contact3.png)

Contacts which are not identified as a default to, cc or bcc recipient
can still be selected as a recipient when emailing a quote or an
invoice.

### How do I create logins for my clients?

BillingTrack provides a limited access client login feature called
Client Center. The Client Center allows clients to log in and view their
own invoices, quotes and payments without being able to access anything
else in your system.

\* Note: Providing login access to your clients is not required to allow
them to pay their invoices online. Clients pay their invoices online
using the public invoice link. The Client Center is intended to provide
a convenient way to provide clients with access to all of their
invoices, quotes and payments in a single area.

User accounts are managed under System -&gt; User Accounts.

[<img src="/img/documentation/user_account_client1_sm.png" class="img-responsive" />](/img/documentation/user_account_client1.png)

To create a client user account, click the New button and then choose
Client Account.

[<img src="/img/documentation/user_account_client2_sm.png" class="img-responsive" />](/img/documentation/user_account_client2.png)

Select the name of the client to create the account for from the
dropdown. The name and email address fields will fill in automatically.
Enter and confirm the account password and press the Save button.

\* Note: If a client isn't listed in the dropdown, it's because a) they
already have a user account, b) their client record doesn't have an
email address, or c) their client record is set to inactive.

[<img src="/img/documentation/user_account_client3_sm.png" class="img-responsive" />](/img/documentation/user_account_client3.png)

Once the account has been created, it will be listed as a Client
account. Client accounts log in using the same URL as admin accounts,
but they will be logged into the Client Center, which provides limited
access to just their invoices, quotes and payments.

### How do I change localization settings for a specific client?

Some of your clients may use different currency, different payment
terms, or speak another language than you do. In this case, you can
adjust these client records to reflect their local currency and native
language.

To do so, edit the client record by clicking the Clients menu item, and
then pressing the Options button on the client to edit and choosing
Edit.

[<img src="/img/documentation/client_edit_sm.png" class="img-responsive" />](/img/documentation/client_edit.png)

The currency, payment terms and language can be adjusted on the
Client Form screen when editing an existing client or adding a new
client.
